To solve the expercise proposed on README I modified the `libc.S` to include a new label called `memsize`, which retrivies the memorize size using the int `$0x12` and returns it. In `main.c`, I used an integer to receive this call of `memsize` and implemented a function (similar to `itoa`) to convert the integer to a string, then printed it. To avoid warnings during the compilation, I created a new function on `stdio.h`.
